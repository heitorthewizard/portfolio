            <h3>Who is Heitor?</h3>

            <p>A modern wizard casting spells with zeros and ones!</p>

            <p>
              Let me tell you a little bit about how I fell in love with
              <em>software development</em>.
              <br />
              In 2019 I was still in high school and working as a
              <em>English teacher</em> at the same institution where I studied
              the language. I was also studying <em>finance</em>,
              <em>business management</em> and <em>economy</em> for fun. I came
              to play a little in the <em>stock market</em> following the
              <em>Warren Buffet's</em> methodology, I was starting to put money
              to work for me.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also really wanted to undertake something profitable and that
              would last for several years, however, I had no idea what to do, I
              was kind of lost. In 2020, around the same time the pandemic
              started, a family member gave me a laptop so I could study with
              better conditions.
            </p>

            <p>
              So one day I was looking at the computer immersed in my thoughts
              until I had an epiphany of how amazing a computer is, a machine
              that you can create whatever you imagine and the single one limit
              is the hardware, the possibility of creating new worlds,
              <em>solving problems</em> with <em>automation</em> and
              <em>innovating</em> got me really excited! And I decided that I
              was going to learn <em>software development</em> just for fun. I
              ended up falling <em>in love</em> and losing track of time while
              <em>studying</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              As I've always been considered a <em>creative person</em> and I
              consider myself an <em>artist</em>, I thought it was the ideal
              field for me, a mixture of human and exact sciences, it perfectly
              fit my characteristics and goals. For example, being able
              <em>to work from anywhere in the world</em>, being able to work
              while traveling, enjoying life, and being able to
              <em>create something great</em> with just a computer and internet
              access, as some people who founded their companies from a garage
              and even from their own room. A universe of
              <em>infinite possibilities</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm a <em>highly focused</em> guy, <em>proactive</em>,
              <em>understanding</em>, <em>fun</em>, <em>ambitious</em> and
              <em>smart</em>. I strongly follow the <em>Stoic philosophy</em>,
              which helps me to handle life in a lighter and more balanced way.
              I place thought and action resulting in a <em>common good</em>,
              which is the stoic <em>virtue of Justice</em>. I free myself from
              distractions, I only focus on those things that I can control and
              do everything as if it was my last act,
              <em>giving the best of myself</em>. I believe that by
              <em>improving myself</em>, I am <em>improving the world</em>.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Heitor The Wizard?</h3>

            <p>
              I believe that computers are something magical, an artifact that
              manipulates energy as we wish, allowing us to express our
              imagination, where anything is possible. They allow us to interact
              with others on the other side of the world in real time, record
              our best moments with loved ones, and also remember the voice and
              image of those we once loved and who are gone.
              <em>They make our lives easier</em> on a daily basis, they help
              debilitated people. They help us to cure diseases, to
              <em>solve problems</em> that would take years and years to be
              solved without them.
              <em>It is the humanity's most important creation</em>. It's unreal
              how we've taken elements from nature and turn them into this 100%
              logical "box". Therefore, I believe that the people who manipulate
              this artifact are actually manipulating energy, creating new
              universes, programs, applications, games, etc. Amazing
              <em>works of art</em>. These people to me are just like
              <em>wizards casting spells</em>. And I'm one of them!
