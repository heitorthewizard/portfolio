            <h3>Who is Heitor?</h3>

            <p>A modern wizard casting spells with zeros and ones! &#128518;</p>

            <p>
              Let me tell you a little bit about the story of how I fell in love
              with <em>software development</em>.
              <br />
              In 2019 I was still in high school and working at the same time as
              an <em>English teacher</em> at the same institution where I
              studied English. I was also studying <em>finance</em>,
              <em>business management</em> and <em>economy</em> for fun. I even
              got to play a little bit in the <em>stock market</em> following
              <em>Warren Buffet's method</em>, I wanted to start putting money
              to work for me.
              <br />
            </p>

            <p>
              I really wanted to undertake something sustainable that would last
              for many years, but I had no idea what to do, I was quite lost. In
              2020, around the same time the pandemic started, a relative gave
              me a laptop so I could study in a better way.
            </p>

            <p>
              So one day I was looking at the computer immersed in my thoughts
              until I had an epiphany of how amazing a computer is, a machine
              that you can create whatever you imagine and the single one limit
              is the hardware, the possibility of creating new worlds,
              <em>solving problems</em> and <em>innovating</em> got me really
              excited! And I decided that I was going to learn
              <em>software development</em> just for fun. I ended up falling
              <em>in love</em> and losing track of time while <em>studying</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              As I always thought of myself as a <em>creative person</em> and
              consider myself an <em>artist</em>, I thought it was the perfect
              area for me, which completely fit my characteristics and goals.
              For example, being able to <em>work from anywhere</em> in the
              world, being able to work while traveling, being able to create
              something great with just a computer and internet access, among
              infinite possibilities.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am <em>highly focused</em>, <em>proactive</em>,
              <em>understanding</em>, <em>fun</em>, <em>smart</em> and
              <em>ambitious</em>. I strongly follow the
              <em>Stoic philosophy</em> which helps me to handle life in a
              lighter way. I place thought and action resulting in a
              <em>common good</em>, which is the Stoic
              <em>virtue of Justice</em>. I free myself from distractions, I
              only focus on what's in my control and do everything as if it were
              my my last act.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Heitor The Wizard?</h3>

            <p>
              I believe computers are something magical, an artifact that
              manipulates energy as we wish, allowing us to express our
              imagination, where anything is possible. A magic box which we can
              interact with other people in another side of the world in real
              time, record our special moments with our beloved ones and, even
              remember the voice and image of the ones we once loved who are
              gone. It's unreal how we've taken elements from nature and turn
              them into this one hundred percent logical box...
              <br />
              I believe the people who create these universes, games, programs,
              applications, and all those pieces of art are
              <em>modern wizards</em>. And I am one of them!! &#128526;
            </p>

            <h3>My Mission</h3>

            <p>
              I <em>seek</em> to acquire <em>experience</em> by applying
              software development to everything I'm working on,
              <em>bringing innovation, automation, value and problem solving</em
              >. I'd love to understand how a great company works, how to
              <em>team up with capable people</em> with whom I can
              <em>learn from</em> and <em>evolve</em> as much as I can,
              <em>improving my skills</em> on dealing with people,
              <em>negotiations, problem solving and software development</em>. I
              want to <em>leave a legacy of great value</em> wherever I go. Only
              then I will be able to start my own business that so far I have
              no idea what is it gonna be.
